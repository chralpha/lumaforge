# Third-Party Notices

This package builds a Luma-owned WebAssembly wrapper around pinned upstream native libraries.
The generated `dist/native/luma_raw.wasm` artifact may contain object code from the components below.

Upstream LibRaw states that LibRaw is distributed under LGPL-2.1 or CDDL-1.0 license options.
It also carries upstream copyright and acknowledgement notices for LibRaw LLC, Dave Coffin's `dcraw.c`, DCB/FBDD code, X3F tools, and Adobe DNG SDK code.
Do not remove those notices.

LumaForge does not vendor or link against `libraw-wasm` or `LibRaw-Wasm`; LibRaw is fetched from the pinned upstream source archive and built locally by `native/scripts/build-deps.sh`.

## Compliance Checklist For Native Artifact Distribution

- Keep this file, `LICENSE`, and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/` beside redistributed package artifacts.
- Keep `native/sources.lock.json` so recipients can identify exact native source archives and hashes.
- Keep the native wrapper and build scripts available from this package source tree.
- Run `pnpm --filter @lumaforge/luma-raw-runtime native:verify` before shipping generated native artifacts.
- Run `pnpm --filter @lumaforge/luma-raw-runtime native:verify-baseline` to confirm no `libraw-wasm` or local baseline artifacts are active build inputs.
