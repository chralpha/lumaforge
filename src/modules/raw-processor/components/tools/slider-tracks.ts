/**
 * Track gradient builders for direction-indicating sliders on the /raw
 * darkroom chrome.
 *
 * Returned strings are CSS `background` values intended for the Slider
 * primitive's `track` prop. Stops are tuned to keep the photo as the hero:
 * gradients sit at ~55% perceived brightness on the dark cool-slate surface,
 * with a neutral mid-shaft so the centre never has zero visual weight and
 * the named end stops pull the eye to the direction of the deviation.
 *
 * The Slider primitive renders a bipolar amber overlay on top of these
 * gradients to indicate "offset from neutral"; helpers here only describe
 * the resting/preview track itself.
