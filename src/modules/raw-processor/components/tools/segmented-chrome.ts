/**
 * Shared segmented-control language for /raw chrome.
 *
 * Strength (LUT lift amount), the mobile LUT contract tabs (input/output),
 * and the desktop LUT contract tabs all render segmented controls on the
 * photo-first dark chrome. Before this contract they had three different
 * paints — paper-warm, on-photo depressed, and a glassy variant — which
 * drifted in readability and cross-platform consistency.
 *
 * The contract here is paint-only. Sizing is per-context (touch needs
 * h-11, mouse density goes h-9 / h-7) and the active-thumb animation
 * (motion `layoutId` plus a `data-segment-thumb` span) stays with each
 * consumer because the animation identity is tied to the surrounding
 * sheet, not to this style sheet.
 *
 * Active visibility uses the Linear pattern: a brighter wash on a dim
 * track plus a font-semibold label, NOT a depressed darker plate with a
 * glassy multi-shadow stack. A single inset top highlight matches the
 * seam idiom used by the topbar, tool rail, and tool cards.

// Track: a 5% cool-white wash on the chrome surface defines the track's
// edge without a drawn border. The earlier border + dim bg-on-photo-bg
// fill was doing all the boundary work; on the mobile LUT sheet (flat
// substrate) the 1px hairline read as the dominant edge of the control,
// while on the desktop tool card (gradient + inset shadow) the same
// hairline became the third structural line in the same field and
// competed with the chrome's existing seams. Per §6 Inset Hairline
// Rule: chrome seams are inset washes, not drawn borders. Pair with a
// h-* and p-* per consumer density.
